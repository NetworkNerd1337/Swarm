# WiFi Environmental Scan Debug Solution

## Current Status
- **Hardware**: Perfect ✓ (2 WiFi interfaces, iw command working, scanning successful)
- **Server**: Correct ✓ (test created with wifi_environment type)
- **Client**: ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Not executing WiFi environmental test path

## Root Cause Analysis - BUGS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

Based on Test 191, 192, 193, 194 analysis:
1. **Database**: All tests correctly stored as `wifi_environment` type ✓
2. **Server API**: Sending wrong `test_type: 'standard'` to clients ❌ (debugging added)
3. **Client Logic**: Executing standard test path despite WiFi test selection ❌ (FIXED)
4. **Hardcoded WiFi Scan**: Standard tests had automatic WiFi scanning ❌ (FIXED)

**BUGS FOUND**:
- Client had hardcoded WiFi environmental scanning in standard test path (lines 744-759)
- WiFi scanning failed due to "Operation not permitted" (needs sudo for iw scan)
- Server may be sending wrong test_type (debugging added to verify)

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Client Startup Debugging
```python
# Added to client initialization:
- WIFI_SCANNING_AVAILABLE status logging
- Complete WiFi interface detection results
- Primary vs spare interface classification
- Raw iw dev output logging
```

### 2. Enhanced Test Execution Debugging  
```python
# Added to _run_test method:
- Test type received from server
- WiFi interface availability status
- Exact execution path taken (standard vs wifi_environment)
```

### 3. Enhanced WiFi Environmental Test Debugging
```python
# Added to _wifi_environmental_test method:
- WiFi interfaces available for testing
- Spare interface availability
- WiFi scanning execution details
```

## Expected Debug Output

When you restart your client and run a new WiFi Environmental Scan test, you should see:

```
DEBUG: WIFI_SCANNING_AVAILABLE at startup: True
DEBUG: Raw iw dev output: [your iw dev output]
DEBUG: Found interface: wlp1s0
DEBUG: Interface wlp1s0 - Connected: False, SSID: ''
DEBUG: Spare WiFi interface detected: wlp1s0
DEBUG: Found interface: wlan0  
DEBUG: Interface wlan0 - Connected: True, SSID: 'RTHNET'
DEBUG: Primary WiFi interface detected: wlan0 (connected to RTHNET)
DEBUG: Final WiFi detection - Primary: wlan0
DEBUG: Final WiFi detection - Spare interfaces: ['wlp1s0']

[When test starts:]
DEBUG: Test type received: 'wifi_environment' (type: <class 'str'>)
DEBUG: WiFi scanning available: True
DEBUG: WiFi interfaces detected: 2
DEBUG: Spare WiFi interfaces: 1 - ['wlp1s0']
DEBUG: Executing standalone WiFi environmental test for test 192
DEBUG: WiFi interfaces available: 2 - ['wlp1s0', 'wlan0'] 
DEBUG: Spare WiFi interfaces: 1 - ['wlp1s0']
```

## Potential Issues to Check

### 1. Interface Detection Issue
- P2P device interface might interfere with parsing
- Interface order might affect classification
- SSID extraction might fail for connected interfaces

### 2. Test Type Processing Issue  
- Server might not be sending test_type correctly
- Client might not be receiving test_type in config
- String comparison might be case-sensitive

### 3. WiFi Scanning Function Issue
- Permission issues (needs sudo for scanning)
- Interface busy/in-use during scanning  
- Timeout or subprocess errors

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your client** to see the new startup debug output
2. **Create a new WiFi Environmental Scan test** to see execution debug output  
3. **Check client logs** for the debug messages above
4. **Share the debug output** to identify exactly where the issue occurs

The debug output will pinpoint whether the issue is:
- WiFi interface detection failure
- Test type not being received correctly  
- WiFi scanning function failure
- Permission or subprocess issues
